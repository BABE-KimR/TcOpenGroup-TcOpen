# TcUnit Naming Conventions
*First Draft of Naming Conventions*

My first reccomendation would be to follow the Backhoff TwinCAt naming conventions but with some modifications and extensions.  see <https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/tc3_plc_intro/54043198675164555.html&id=>

## Member Variables
Class (FB) member variables should begin with 'm_' followd by the type identifier and then the variable name i.e. m_<TypeIdentifier><VariableName> 
ex. m_bTrigger, m_stAnalogStatus
